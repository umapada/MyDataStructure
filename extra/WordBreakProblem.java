/*
Given an input string and a dictionary of words, find out if the input string can be segmented into a space-separated
sequence of dictionary words. See following examples for more details.
This is a famous Google interview question, also being asked by many other companies now a days.

Consider the following dictionary
{ i, like, sam, sung, samsung, mobile, ice,
  cream, icecream, man, go, mango}

Input:  ilike
Output: Yes
The string can be segmented as "i like".

Input:  ilikesamsung
Output: Yes
The string can be segmented as "i like samsung"
or "i like sam sung".

 */

// Solution

/*
Recursive implementation:
The idea is simple, we consider each prefix and search it in dictionary. If the prefix is present in dictionary,
we recur for rest of the string (or suffix). If the recursive call for suffix returns true, we return true,
otherwise we try next prefix. If we have tried all prefixes and none of them resulted in a solution, we return false.
