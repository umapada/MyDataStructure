/**
 * Maximum Length Chain of Pairs | DP-20
 * You are given n pairs of numbers. In every pair, the first number is always smaller than the second number. A pair (c, d) can follow another pair (a, b) if b < c. Chain of pairs can be formed in this fashion. Find the longest chain which can be formed from a given set of pairs.
 * Source: Amazon Interview | Set 2
 *
 * For example, if the given pairs are {{5, 24}, {39, 60}, {15, 28}, {27, 40}, {50, 90} }, then the longest chain that can be formed is of length 3, and the chain is {{5, 24}, {27, 40}, {50, 90}}
 */


/**
 * This problem is a variation of standard Longest Increasing Subsequence problem. Following is a simple two step process.
 * 1) Sort given pairs in increasing order of first (or smaller) element. Why do not need sorting? Consider the example {{6, 8}, {3, 4}} to understand the need of sorting. If we proceed to second step without sorting, we get output as 1. But the correct output is 2.
 * 2) Now run a modified LIS process where we compare the second element of already finalized LIS with the first element of new LIS being constructed.
