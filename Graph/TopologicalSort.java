 * Topological Sorting
 * Topological sorting for Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is a linear ordering of vertices such that for every
 * directed edge uv, vertex u comes before v in the ordering. Topological Sorting for a graph is not possible if
 * the graph is not a DAG.

/**
 * Algorithm to find Topological Sorting:
 * We recommend to first see implementation of DFS here. We can modify DFS to find Topological Sorting of a graph.
 * In DFS, we start from a vertex, we first print it and then recursively call DFS for its adjacent vertices.
 * In topological sorting, we use a temporary stack. We donâ€™t print the vertex immediately, we first recursively
 * call topological sorting for all its adjacent vertices, then push it to a stack. Finally, print contents of stack.
 * Note that a vertex is pushed to stack only when all of its adjacent vertices (and their adjacent vertices and so on)
 * are already in stack.
