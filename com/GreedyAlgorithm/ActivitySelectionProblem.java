/**
 * Activity Selection Problem | Greedy Algo-1
 * Greedy is an algorithmic paradigm that builds up a solution piece by piece, always choosing the next piece that
 * offers the most obvious and immediate benefit. Greedy algorithms are used for optimization problems. An optimization
 * problem can be solved using Greedy if the problem has the following property: At every step, we can make a choice
 * that looks best at the moment, and we get the optimal solution of the complete problem.
 * If a Greedy Algorithm can solve a problem, then it generally becomes the best method to solve that problem as the
 * Greedy algorithms are in general more efficient than other techniques like Dynamic Programming. But Greedy algorithms
 * cannot always be applied. For example, Fractional Knapsack problem (See this) can be solved using Greedy,
 * but 0-1 Knapsack cannot be solved using Greedy.
 *
 * Following are some standard algorithms that are Greedy algorithms.
 * 1) Kruskal’s Minimum Spanning Tree (MST): In Kruskal’s algorithm, we create a MST by picking edges one by one.
 * The Greedy Choice is to pick the smallest weight edge that doesn’t cause a cycle in the MST constructed so far.
 * 2) Prim’s Minimum Spanning Tree: In Prim’s algorithm also, we create a MST by picking edges one by one. We maintain
 * two sets: a set of the vertices already included in MST and the set of the vertices not yet included. The Greedy
 * Choice is to pick the smallest weight edge that connects the two sets.
 * 3) Dijkstra’s Shortest Path: The Dijkstra’s algorithm is very similar to Prim’s algorithm. The shortest path tree is
 * built up, edge by edge. We maintain two sets: a set of the vertices already included in the tree and the set of the
 * vertices not yet included. The Greedy Choice is to pick the edge that connects the two sets and is on the smallest
 * weight path from source to the set that contains not yet included vertices.
 * 4) Huffman Coding: Huffman Coding is a loss-less compression technique. It assigns variable-length bit codes to
 * different characters. The Greedy Choice is to assign least bit length code to the most frequent character.
 *
 * The greedy algorithms are sometimes also used to get an approximation for Hard optimization problems. For example,
 * Traveling Salesman Problem is a NP-Hard problem. A Greedy choice for this problem is to pick the nearest unvisited
 * city from the current city at every step. This solutions don’t always produce the best optimal solution but can be
 * used to get an approximately optimal solution.

/**
 * Let us consider the Activity Selection problem as our first example of Greedy algorithms. Following is the problem
 * statement. You are given n activities with their start and finish times. Select the maximum number of activities
 * that can be performed by a single person, assuming that a person can only work on a single activity at a time.
 * Example:
 *
 * Example 1 : Consider the following 3 activities sorted by by finish time.
 *      start[]  =  {10, 12, 20};
 *      finish[] =  {20, 25, 30};
 * A person can perform at most two activities. The maximum set of activities that can be executed
 * is {0, 2} [ These are indexes in start[] and finish[] ]
 *
 * Example 2 : Consider the following 6 activities sorted by by finish time.
 *      start[]  =  {1, 3, 0, 5, 8, 5};
 *      finish[] =  {2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 9};
 * A person can perform at most four activities. The maximum set of activities that can be executed
 * is {0, 1, 3, 4} [ These are indexes in start[] and finish[] ]
 *
 *
 * The greedy choice is to always pick the next activity whose finish time is least among the remaining activities and
 * the start time is more than or equal to the finish time of previously selected activity. We can sort the activities
 * according to their finishing time so that we always consider the next activity as minimum finishing time activity.
 *
 * 1) Sort the activities according to their finishing time
 * 2) Select the first activity from the sorted array and print it.
 * 3) Do following for remaining activities in the sorted array.
 * …….a) If the start time of this activity is greater than or equal to the finish time of previously selected activity
 * then select this activity and print it.
 *
 * In the following C implementation, it is assumed that the activities are already sorted according to their finish time.
