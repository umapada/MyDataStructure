/**
 * Longest Consecutive Subsequence
 * Given an array of integers, find the length of the longest sub-sequence such that elements in the subsequence are consecutive integers, the consecutive numbers can be in any order.
 * Examples:
 *
 * Input: arr[] = {1, 9, 3, 10, 4, 20, 2}
 * Output: 4
 * The subsequence 1, 3, 4, 2 is the longest subsequence
 * of consecutive elements
 *
 *
 *
 * Input: arr[] = {36, 41, 56, 35, 44, 33, 34, 92, 43, 32, 42}
 * Output: 5
 * The subsequence 36, 35, 33, 34, 32 is the longest subsequence
 * of consecutive elements.

/**
 * One Solution is to first sort the array and find the longest subarray with consecutive elements. Time complexity
 * of this solution is O(nLogn). Thanks to Hao.W for suggesting this solution.
 *
 * We can solve this problem in O(n) time using an Efficient Solution. The idea is to use Hashing. We first insert
 * all elements in a Set. Then check all the possible starts of consecutive subsequences. Below is the complete algorithm.
 *
 * Create an empty hash.
 * Insert all array elements to hash.
 * Do following for every element arr[i]
 * Check if this element is the starting point of a subsequence. To check this, we simply look for arr[i] â€“ 1 in
 * the hash, if not found, then this is the first element a subsequence.
 * If this element is the first element, then count number of elements in the consecutive starting with this element.
 * Iterate from arr[i] + 1 till the last element that can be found.
 * If the count is more than the previous longest subsequence found, then update this.
