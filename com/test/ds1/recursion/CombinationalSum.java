/**
 * Given an array of positive integers arr[] and a sum x, find all unique combinations in arr[] where the sum is equal
 * to x. The same repeated number may be chosen from arr[] unlimited number of times. Elements in a combination
 * (a1, a2, …, ak) must be printed in non-descending order. (ie, a1 <= a2 <= … <= ak).
 * The combinations themselves must be sorted in ascending order, i.e., the combination with smallest first element
 * should be printed first. If there is no combination possible the print "Empty" (without quotes).
 *
 * Examples:
 *
 * Input : arr[] = 2, 4, 6, 8
 *             x = 8
 * Output : [2, 2, 2, 2]
 *          [2, 2, 4]
 *          [2, 6]
 *          [4, 4]
 *          [8]

/**
 * Since the problem is to get all the possible results, not the best or the number of result, thus we don’t need to
 * consider DP(dynamic programming), recursion is needed to handle it.
 *
 * We should use the following algorithm.
 *
 * 1. Sort the array(non-decreasing).
 * 2. First remove all the duplicates from array.
 * 3. Then use recursion and backtracking to solve
 *    the problem.
 *    (A) If at any time sub-problem sum == 0 then
 *        add that array to the result (vector of
 *        vectors).
 *    (B) Else if sum if negative then ignore that
 *        sub-problem.
 *    (C) Else insert the present array in that
 *        index to the current vector and call
 *        the function with sum = sum-ar[index] and
 *        index = index, then pop that element from
 *        current index (backtrack) and call the
 *        function with sum = sum and index = index+1
