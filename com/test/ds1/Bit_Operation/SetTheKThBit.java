 * Set the K-th bit of a given number
 * Given a number n and a value k. From the right, set the kth bit in the binary representation of n.
 * The position of LSB(or last bit) is 0, second last bit is 1 and so on. Also, 0 <= k < x, where x is the number
 * of bits in the binary representation of n.
 *
 * Examples:
 *
 * Input : n = 10, k = 2
 * Output : 14
 * (10)10 = (1010)2
 * Now, set the 2nd bit from right.
 * (14)10 = (1110)2
 * 2nd bit has been set.
 *
 * Input : n = 15, k = 3
 * Output : 15
 * 3rd bit of 15 is already set.
