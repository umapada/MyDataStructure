/**
 * Sort an array according to the order defined by another array
 * Given two arrays A1[] and A2[], sort A1 in such a way that the relative order among the elements will be same as
 * those are in A2. For the elements not present in A2, append them at last in sorted order.
 * Example:
 *
 *  Input: A1[] = {2, 1, 2, 5, 7, 1, 9, 3, 6, 8, 8}
 *        A2[] = {2, 1, 8, 3}
 * Output: A1[] = {2, 2, 1, 1, 8, 8, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9}
 * The code should handle all cases like the number of elements in A2[] may be more or less compared to A1[].
 * A2[] may have some elements which may not be there in A1[] and vice versa is also possible.

    /**
     * Method 2 (Using Self-Balancing Binary Search Tree)
     *
     * We can also use a self balancing BST like AVL Tree, Red Black Tree, etc. Following are detailed steps.
     *
     * Create a self balancing BST of all elements in A1[]. In every node of BST, also keep track of count of
     * occurrences of the key and a bool field visited which is initialized as false for all nodes.
     * Initialize the output index ind as 0. Do following for every element of A2[i] in A2[]
     * Search for A2[i] in the BST, if present then copy all occurrences to A1[ind] and increment ind. Also mark the
     * copied elements visited in the BST node. Do an inorder traversal of BST and copy all unvisited keys to A1[].
     * Time Complexity of this method is same as the previous method. Note that in a self balancing Binary Search Tree,
     * all operations require logm time.
     *
     * Method 3 (Use Hashing)
     *
     * Loop through A1[], store the count of every number in a HashMap (key: number, value: count of number)
     * Loop through A2[], check if it is present in HashMap, if so, put in output array that many times and remove
     * the number from HashMap. Sort the rest of the numbers present in HashMap and put in output array.
     *
     *
     *
     * Method 4 (By Writing a Customized Compare Method)
     * We can also customize compare method of a sorting algorithm to solve the above problem.
     *
     * If num1 and num2 both are in A2 then number with lower index in A2 will be treated smaller than other.
     * If only one of num1 or num2 present in A2, then that number will be treated smaller than the other which doesnâ€™t present in A2.
     * If both are not in A2, then natural ordering will be taken.
     * Time complexity of this method is O(mnLogm) if we use a O(nLogn) time complexity sorting algorithm. We can
     * improve time complexity to O(mLogm) by using a Hashing instead of doing linear search.
